# LPSW-API-Assesment

For this assessment, we needed to look through the 2019 Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs. We gathered all of the datasets through the obtaining of a token.
Every group member individually merged all the tables together to create one final master table and cleaned/transformed the data.
After wards each group member created questions we individually wanted to answer and each of us created 3 visualizations for a total of 12 visualizations.
You can see this information in our group code.
Also we created a project report file in which we each walk you through our visualizations and results we obtained.
Furthermore, we created an ETL report in which we each walk you through the steps we went through to gather our API's, merge our dataframes, clean/transform our data,
and create our visualizations. We hope you will use each one of these documents for your knowledge and understanding.
